# Reasoning explination
I used both an abstract class and an interface for the individual vehicle type classes (i.e. Car and Boat). The reason for this is I wanted to 
implement automatic random number generation for some of the properties in the classes that did not require specific inputs (i.e. Weight, Height
and the like). The implementation of the Interface seems faily straightforward, however.

If you are curious about reasoning behind other decisions or wondering why something is missing, please speak with me. There may be a reason.
